# Isenberg_Notebook

This notebook visually documents the creative process behind the development of the Isenberg project: a algorithmic adaptation of BIG Architectsâ€™ Business Innovation Hub for the Isenberg School of Management in Amherst, Massachusetts. This project was developed using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and the Khepri algorithmic design tool, running on the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Currently, the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) viewer for Jupyter does not have a Julia Kernel available online. To run this notebook interactively you must install IJulia on your PC. Use the saved screenshots to confirm that the notebook is yielding the expected results. Alternatively you may simply browse through the final version of the notebook on Binder ([here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RenataCB/Isenberg_Notebook/blob/master/Isenberg.ipynb)) or here on GitHub by opening the Isenberg.ipynb file.
